Welcome to my website! My name is Ara Patvakanian (Արա Պատվականյան). I hold a degree in Mathematical Economics and Political Science from the University of Pennsylvania. I am passionate about bringing analytical, theoretical, and empirical tools to bear on various problems of economic, social, and political consequence. My current interests center on macroeconomic modeling, time series econometrics, and monetary policy. For more on my background, [see this article published by Penn](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/who-what-why-ara-patvakanian) in April 2024. I work at the Research Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston as a research assistant in the Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics group and plan on pursuing a Ph.D. in economics afterwards. 
<!-- 
Throughout my time at Penn, I worked on various research projects and wrote my undergraduate thesis in economics. I also served in multiple leadership positions: I was a two-year member and chairman of the Penn Department of Economics Undergraduate Advisory Board, former Co-President of the Penn Undergraduate Economics Society, Co-President of the Penn Armenian Students Association, and a Resident Advisor (RA) in Harrison College House. -->

In my free time, I enjoy playing my guitar—which I have been playing for over 11 years—and listening to music. I also play the ukelele. I am currently learning French. Last, I love reading philosophy and political theory, and my favorite novel is *The Count of Monte Cristo* by Alexandre Dumas.
