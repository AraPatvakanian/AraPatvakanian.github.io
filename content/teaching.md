        # Teaching
        \
        All teaching materials are available in the [APTeachingLibrary](https://github.com/AraPatvakanian/APTeachingLibrary) repository on my GitHub, which contains notes, slides, and illustrative sample code primarily of interest to researchers working in economics. I hope to add more modules in the future while improving and expanding existing ones.
