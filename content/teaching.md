# __Teaching__ 
\
All teaching materials are available in the [APTeachingLibrary](https://github.com/AraPatvakanian/APTeachingLibrary) repository on my GitHub. This GitHub repository contains teaching material (notes, slides, and illustrative sample code) for researchers working in economics. I hope to add more modules in the future while improving and expanding existing ones.

All errors are my own. If you find an error or have a comment or suggestion, please contact me at [arap15@upenn.edu](mailto:arap15@upenn.edu).
