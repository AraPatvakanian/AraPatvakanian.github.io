I hold a degree in Mathematical Economics and Political Science from the University of Pennsylvania. I am passionate about bringing analytical, theoretical, and empirical tools to bear on various problems of economic, social, and political consequence. My current interests center on macroeconomic modeling, time series econometrics, and monetary policy. For more on my background, see this article published by Penn in April 2024. I will join the Research Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in June 2024 and plan on pursuing a Ph.D. in economics afterwards.\nIn my free time, I enjoy playing my guitar—which I have been playing for over 11 years—and listening to music. I also play the ukelele. I am currently learning French. Last, I love reading philosophy and political theory, and my favorite novel is The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Welcome to my website!
