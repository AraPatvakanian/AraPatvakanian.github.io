I hold a degree in Mathematical Economics and Political Science from the University of Pennsylvania and am currently a graduate visiting student at Harvard University. I work at the Research Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston as a research assistant in the Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics group and plan on pursuing a Ph.D. in economics afterwards. For more on my background, see this article published by Penn in April 2024.\nIn my free time, I enjoy playing the guitar and the ukelele. I am currently learning French. Last, I love reading philosophy and political theory, and my favorite novel is The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas.\nAll expressed views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston or the Federal Reserve System.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Welcome to my website!
